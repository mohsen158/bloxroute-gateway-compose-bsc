# Logs Directory

This directory contains log files generated by the bloXroute Gateway container.

## Log Files

The following log files may be created by the gateway:

- `gateway.log` - Main gateway application logs
- `error.log` - Error logs
- `access.log` - Access logs
- `debug.log` - Debug logs (if enabled)

## Log Rotation

Log files are automatically rotated by the container. Old log files are typically compressed and archived.

## Monitoring

You can monitor logs in real-time using:

```bash
# View all logs
docker-compose logs -f bxgateway-go

# View specific log file
tail -f logs/gateway.log
```

## Log Levels

The gateway supports different log levels:
- ERROR: Error messages
- WARN: Warning messages  
- INFO: Informational messages
- DEBUG: Debug messages

## Configuration

Log level and output can be configured via environment variables in the `.env` file.
